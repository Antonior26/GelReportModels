* `monoallelic_paternally_imprinted`: MONOALLELIC, autosomal or pseudoautosomal, paternally imprinted (maternal allele expressed)
* `monoallelic`: MONOALLELIC, autosomal or pseudoautosomal, imprinted status unknown

* `xlinked_biallelic`: X-LINKED: hemizygous mutation in males, biallelic mutations in females
* `xlinked_monoallelic`: X linked: hemizygous mutation in males, monoallelic mutations in females may cause disease (may be less severe, later onset than males)
* `mitochondrial`: MITOCHONDRIAL
