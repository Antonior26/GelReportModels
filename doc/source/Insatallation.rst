Instalation
===========

This is a quick guide to build and install the GelModels, this is project has three well defined different parts:
Models definitions, python implementation and converters.

.. note::
    You can use the model definition as them self, if this is your case and you are not interested in use the clases from
    python it is not necesary follow this guide

Several consideration has to be taken in acount before to start the installation process: This packages provide a code generation
form AVRO schema, that means that the code of the python clases in this package were automatically generated, so if you have made
any change in the model you should build the classes again, otherwise wont be equivalent to your new version.
